<h2 id="weddings">WEDDINGS</h2>
<br />
WEDDING, engagement or couple shoots start at $150 per hour for a local shoot. Additional costs may apply for travel outside of LA.
<br /><br />
An engagement photo session is a great way to meet your photographers and to shake off those pre-wedding photo nerves. More importantly it's a great way for them to get to know you. Think of it as meeting for a cup of coffee the day before your first date. It helps you decide if you want to go on the date or not. You're marriage is very important and should be shot by someone you trust and know is going to capture every moment. As well as capturing your personality humor and charm before the "big day".
