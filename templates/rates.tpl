<h2 id="film set photography (movie set stills)">FILM SET Photography (Movie Set Stills)</h2><br />One of the most overlooked contributions to film production is that of the<br />still photographer - great pictures that accurately depict not only production stills <br />from the film but also behind the scenes pictures of the production as well. <br />The pictures captured from any given production are mainly used for marketing and <br />advertising as they provide the highest quality photographs (RAW) of scenes from <br />the film. These pictures are also used as historical documentation of the film as well <br />as pictorial reference for many of the production's many departments (i.e. wardrobe, <br />location, continuity, cinematography, etc.).<br />Rate:  please call for quote!<br /><br /> 

<h2 id="weddings / events">WEDDINGS / EVENTS</h2>
<br />
WEDDING, engagement or couple shoots start at $199 per hour for a local shoot. <br />
Additional costs may apply for travel outside of LA.
<br /><br />
An ENGAGEMENT photo session is a great way to meet your photographers and to shake off those <br />
pre-wedding photo nerves. More importantly it's a great way for them to get to know you. <br />
Think of it as meeting for a cup of coffee the day before your first date. It helps you decide <br />
if you want to go on the date or not. You're marriage is very important and should be shot by <br />
someone you trust and know is going to capture every moment. As well as capturing your personality, <br />
humor and charm before the "big day".
