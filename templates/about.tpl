"To say I had a great shoot with Sandra Simon, would be a huge understatement. I had a five star experience working with her 
from pre all the way through to post production. She is the perfect blend of professionalism, precision, patience, with a great attitude, 
energy and enthusiasm. The difficulty my agent had in narrowing down my final picks for my portfolio, because there were so many 
great choices, is a testament to her work." - Aviel AV Ayoung (Dancer,Actor)
