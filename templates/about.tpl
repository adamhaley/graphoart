"I love working with Sandra because she's an awesome person but also because as my photographer, she understand what story I want to tell through the pictures and she successfully shoots it. During the shoot, she's very helpful, has great ideas, makes you feel relaxed and is dedicated to you.  The photos she took are amazing. Thank you so much Sandra." - <i>Delphine Perroud</i>

"To say I had a great shoot with Sandra Simon, would be a huge understatement. I had a five star experience working with her 
from pre all the way through to post production. She is the perfect blend of professionalism, precision, patience, with a great attitude, 
energy and enthusiasm. The difficulty my agent had in narrowing down my final picks for my portfolio, because there were so many 
great choices, is a testament to her work." - <i>Aviel AV Ayoung (Dancer,Actor)</i>
